Ultracentrifugation (Beckman Coulter) was performed at 100,000g for 120 minutes using a Ti70 rotor to pellet the remaining EVs.","not provided","Standard nanostring miRNA protocols.","9606","Standard nanostring miRNA hybridisation protocols.","Long","H10","nsolver v3","GPL30060","Robert,,Maile","robmaile@med.unc.edu","9194428173","Robert Maile","UNC CH","8031 Burnett Womack","Chapel Hill","NC","27599","USA","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM5269nnn/GSM5269086/suppl/GSM5269086_20200928_PancMV2_23B_10.RCC.gz","828","no","miRNA","peripheral blood microvesicles"
