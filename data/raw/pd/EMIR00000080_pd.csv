The supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube for exosome isolation. ExoQuick (Cat# EXOQ5A-1, System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) was added to the supernatant at 1:4 ratio (ExoQuick:Supernatant), mixed gently, and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 4 掳C. After the incubation, the admixture was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for additional 30 min to recover the exosomes. Using ExoQuick-based precipitation techniques for exosome isolation and recovery is broadly recognized for better specific exosomal miRNAs recovery and lower intra-assay coefficients of variability (CVs) compared to other commercial exosome isolation kits, and is also backed in nearly 600 peer-review citations.","Exosomes extracted from the samples were processed for total RNA isola- tion using the SeraMir Exosome RNA Purification Column kit (Cat #RA808A-1, System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer鈥檚 instructions. For each sample, 1 渭l of the final RNA eluate was used for meas- urement of small RNA concentration by Agilent Bioanalyzer Small RNA Assay using Bioanalyzer 2100 Expert instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A small RNA concentration of 200 pg/ul was considers as a cutoff for subsequent library preparation.","Small RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols. Small Small RNA libraries were constructed with the CleanTag Small RNA Library Preparation Kit (Cat# L-3206, TriLink BioTechnologies, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer鈥檚 protocol","The final purified library was quanti- fied with High Sensitivity DNA Reagents (PO# G2933-85004, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and High Sensitivity DNA Chips (PO# 5067–4626, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).","The libraries were pooled, and the 140 bp to 300 bp region was size selected on an 8% TBE gel (Ref# EC6215, Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The size selected library was quantified with High Sensitivity DNA 1000 Screen Tape (PO #5067–5584, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), High Sensitivity D1000 reagents (PO# 5067–5585, Agilent  Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and the TailorMix HT1 qPCR assay (Cat# TM-505, SeqMatic, Union City, CA),  followed by a NextSeq High Output single-end sequencing run at SR75 using NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2  kit (Cat #FC-404-2005, Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.","Then, the open-source tools including FastqMcf, part  of the EA-utils package, and PRINSEQ were used to detect and remove N鈥檚 at the ends of reads, trim sequencing  adapters, and filter reads for quality and length. The improved set of sequence reads were mapped to the  reference genome using Bowtie and expression levels for exosomal miRNAs were calculated using R statistical  environment","9606","The circulating e-miRNA expression levels of the baseline blood samples of the  matched subjects were measured and processed through the workflow mentioned above","cut-off value of 500  was set as a minimal valid read counts per miRNA to eliminate the noise that had been produced in sequencing.  Expression data were further normalized using the DESeq method","Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce data dimensionality.","The principal components  (PCs) accounting for 95% of the total variance of the data were selected and calculated for each patient","The association between the PCs and recurrent ischemic events were evaluated via Mann-Whitney tests with  Bonferroni correction to determine the predictive PC for recurrent ischemic events and reduce the false discovery  rate; binary logistic model was then generated to calculate the sensitivity and specificity via a receiver operative  curve (ROC).","To further scale the contribution of each e-miRNA to the predictive PC, the absolute coefficients  of all the e-miRNAs in the PC formula were distributed in a quartile box plot, and the e-miRNAs with the coefficients  above 75% quartile were selected.","To interpret the regulatory effect of these selected e-miRNAs, functional  analysis and miRNA target analysis was carried out in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) environment to mine  the significantly associated biological functions and downstream molecules","The up- and down-regulation of the  specific e-miRNA expression profile in the non-responders on the relevant biological functions and molecules  were predicted via a build-in Molecular Activity Predictor (MAP) tool","The networks, functional analyses, and  miRNA target analyses were generated through the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc, https://www.qiagenbio-informatics.  com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the potential impact  of including TIA in the primary endpoint","The expression levels of the relevant e-miRNAs, identified as described  above, were compared between the whole cohort and including exclusively subjects with stroke.","The statistical analyses including PCA and binary logistic regression analysis were performed in JMP (version  13). A two-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical significance of the  analysis in IPA environment was calculated by causal analytics algorithms which are based on a “master” network  derived from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base","Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Matrix table with raw gene counts for every miRNA and every sample for each group (responder to medical management and non responder)","GPL18573","Miguel,,Quintero","Miguel.quinteroconsuegra@cshs.org","Cedars Sinai medical center","8700","Los Angeles","90036","USA","0","Illumina NextSeq 500","size fractionation","transcriptomic","miRNA-Seq","BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN19789048","SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX11184991","NONE","79","intracranial atherosclerosis","Male","Responder to medical management","Serum"
