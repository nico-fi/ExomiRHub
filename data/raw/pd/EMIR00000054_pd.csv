Differentially expressed miRNAs between two samples were filtered through Fold change.","GPL17107","Xiaofeng,,Guan","18468449@qq.com","(+86)18697995523","First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University","No 6 SHUANGYONG ROAD","Nanning","Guangxi","530021","China","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2995nnn/GSM2995053/suppl/GSM2995053_32.gpr.gz","0","exosomes","HK-2"
