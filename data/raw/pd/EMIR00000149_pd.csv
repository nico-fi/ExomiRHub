Confluent cells are trypsinized and split.","A818.4-Tspan8kd, A818.4-CD151kd, A818.4-CD44v6kd, Capan-1-CD44v6kd  cells were derived from transfection with shRNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and maintained in RPMI1640/10%FCS/pyruvate/L-glutamine/antibiotics containing 0.5μg/ml G418. Single cell kd clones were derived by 2 rounds of single cell cloning.","The human colorectal cancer lines HT29 and SW948 are maintained in RPMI1640/10%FCS/L-glutamine/antibiotics.
