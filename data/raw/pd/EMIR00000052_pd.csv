(6) number of nucleotides in one bulge in mature region (≤4) (7) number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region (≤2) (8) number of biased bulges in mature region (≤2) (9) number of errors in mature region (≤4) (10) number of base pairs in the mature region of the predicted hairpin (≥12) (11) percent of mature in stem (≥80).","Genome_build: mirbase 22","Supplementary_files_format_and_content: miRNA expression profiles","GPL16791","Xiao,,Jiang","jx494329398@gmail.com","Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong University","157 Jingliu Road","Jinan","250021","China","0","Illumina HiSeq 2500","size fractionation","transcriptomic","miRNA-Seq","BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN13706458","SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX7485204","NONE","PCOS women","female","plasma exosome"
