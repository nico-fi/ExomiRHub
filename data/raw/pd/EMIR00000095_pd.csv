Blood was drawn immediately after exercise (Post), and after 3 h of recovery (3h Post) via direct venipuncture using a 21-gauge butterfly needle, and blood samples were collected into K2-EDTA tubes PAXgene blood tubes (Becton-Dickson, Catalog #366643).","total RNA","For exosomal RNA isolation, 700 碌l of Qiazol (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) were added to 50 碌l of exosome preparation, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature.

After the upper aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube, a two-fold volume of absolute ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, US) was added, and the mixture was vortexed briefly. Samples were then transferred to RNeasy mini spin columns (Qiagen) that were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 sec at 4潞C, and flow-through was discarded. An 80-碌l volume of DNase incubation mix was added directly onto the column membrane and samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature.

Briefly, RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using 2 ng of exosomal RNA and 15 cycles of PCR amplification. Libraries were run on a 6% TBE gel for 60 min at 120 V, and bands between 140 to 160 bp were excised from the gel using a razor blade. Gel pieces were crushed into smaller pieces and incubated in water overnight on a rotator. Libraries were isolated using gel filtration columns.
