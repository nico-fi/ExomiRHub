We used three-factor ANCOVA (ID*group (lean vs. obese)*adipose depot; age covariate) to compare miRNA expression, using unadjusted p ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ |1.2| as filters. We generated main effects for group (obesity-state) and tissue depot along with their interaction term. As a part of the overall ANCOVA, we used specific within-group (depot effects within obese or lean) and within-tissue (obesity effects within depot) contrasts.
