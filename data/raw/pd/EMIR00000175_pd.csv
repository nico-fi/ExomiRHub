In detail 100μl serum sample, 250μl nuclease-free water (Life Technologies) and 750μl Trizol LS (Life Technologies) were mixed and incubated at RT for 5min. After addition of 1μl glycogen (20mg/ml) and 5μl 5mM cel spike-in control (Qiagen) and 200μl chloroform the solution was vortexed and incubated at RT for 3min followed by centrifugation at 4°C and 14 000rpm for 15min. The upper aqueous phase was transferred into a new tube and RNA was precipitated using 1.5Vol of 100% ethanol. The solution was added to a RNA binding column from the MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) and RNA was washed and purified using the buffer from the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA including miRNA was eluted in 15μl nuclease-free water and stored at -80°C. RNA concentration was measured using NanoDrop2000 (ThermoScientific). RNA integrity was measured using the Small RNA kit (Agilent) on a Bioanalyzer2100.","Cyanine 3","using miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit (Agilent, Cat.
