The medium used for exosome collection were modified by using an exosome-free culture medium. In brief, we first centrifuged fetal bovine serum at 120,000g 4C overnight to exclude any serum exosomes from the product. The supernatant were syringed through a 0.22μm filter before use.

The cDNA libraries were then processed for the Proton Sequencing process according to the commercially available protocols.
