FBS was depleted of exosomes by ultracentrifugation at 1×106g at 4°C for 16h (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-30I, USA). After being incubated for 48-72h, the culture medium was harvested and isolated by ultracentrifugation. Briefly, cell culture medium was sequentially centrifuged at 300g for 10min, 2,000g for 15min, and 12,000g for 30min to remove floating cells and cellular debris. These were then passed through a 0.22μm filter. The supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 1×106 g for 2h at 4°C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and submitted to a second ultracentrifugation in the same conditions.
