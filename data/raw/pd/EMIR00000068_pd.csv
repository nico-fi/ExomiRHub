We first performed differential centrifugation (1000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 16,500 g for 30 min at 4 °C) to remove the cell debris, followed by ultrafiltration using 0.22 μm filters. We then performed ultracentrifugation (120,000 g for 2 hours) to obtain exosome pellets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to visualize exosomes. The exosome pellets were first suspended and dropped onto 200 mesh copper grids, followed by incubation in 3% phosphotungstic acid for 10 min. The copper mesh was then washed three times with water and dried for observation by TEM.
