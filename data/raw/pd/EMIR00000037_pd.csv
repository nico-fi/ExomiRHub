After the attachment of the cells, the medium was replaced by EGM-2 (without SingleQuot FBS; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 2% exosome-depleted FBS from Gibco (Waltham, MA, USA) and cells were put into hypoxia incubator (2% O2). The conditioned media were collected from the confluent pericyte cultures every 3 days and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 minutes to remove cells. Then, supernatant was transferred into a new centrifuge tube and spun at 16,000 × g for 30 minutes to remove any remaining cell debris. The supernatant was transferred into a new falcon and kept at -80 °C until use.
