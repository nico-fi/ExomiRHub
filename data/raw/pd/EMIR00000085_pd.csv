The resulting supernatant is designated plasma. The plasma was transferred to clean polypropylene tubes in 100ul aliquots and frozen at -80掳C. Prior to exosome isolation or RNA extraction, plasma was spun at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4掳C to remove platelet and large particles. EVs were isolated using size exclusion columns (SEC) (iZON qEV, city state) from a total of 22 selected samples, 11 from each group (Supplemental Table 1). EVs were isolated from 100 ul of plasma using size exclusion columns (iZON qEV, Cambridge MA) with de-gassed 1X PBS from a total of 22 selected samples, 11 from each group (Table 1). Eluate (~500 碌l for each fraction) was collected in microfuge tubes individually. The protein contains and concentration for each fraction were assessed by protein gel electrophoresis and Bradford assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA).  The EV fractions (usually from fraction 7 to 10) and EV-depleted fractions (fractions 11 to 35) were pooled and concentrated to ~100 碌l using Amicon 10K centrifugation filters (EMD Millipore, Billerica MA) spun in a swing-bucket rotor at 4000 x g at 4oC for 20 minutes.","total RNA","RNA was isolated from all plasma samples, the 22 EV samples, and 22 corresponding EV-depleted fractions using miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagne, Germantown MD).  The quality and quantity of the RNA were evaluated with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA) and NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE)","Small RNA sequencing libraries were generated with a modified small RNAseq protocol (manuscript in preparation) that alleviates most of the adapter-miRNA ligation sequence bias problem. Key elements of this small RNA library construction method include the addition of 4 random nucleotides at the appropriate end of the adapters, the use of higher adapter concentrations, and the increased amounts of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the ligation steps to ensure the completion of ligation reactions. In addition, to reduce the amplification of adapter-dimer, we adapted a two-stage size-selection step in which an initial size selection is performed after 4 cycles of amplification followed by a second size selection after 11 (?) cycles of amplification of ligated fragments from the first size selection step. The quality of libraries was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the DNA 1000 chip.  Individual library concentrations were measured using the NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich MA) and adjusted to a final pooled concertation of 2 nM and sequenced using the NEXTseq DNA sequencer (Illumina, San Diego CA).","9606","the adaptor sequences, were trimmed and the low quality sequences such as low nucleotide complexity reads – homopolymer sequences or di-, tri-nucleotide repeat sequences were removed. The processed sequences were then mapped against various databases including known human miRNA, human transcripts, followed by human genomic sequence. We also applied three different levels of error tolerance: 0 mismatch, 1 mismatch and 2 mismatches when align to the human sequence databases.  The remaining unmapped sequences were then compared to sequences from other species, and the non-redundant nucleic acid sequence collection from NCBI.
